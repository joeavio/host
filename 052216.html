Joe Avio<br>
Release Date of November 7, 2018<br></div>


"<a href=https://soundcloud.com/user-189801548-24149618/baby/s-vzNeG>'Baby'</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-189801548-24149618/fall-into-pieces/s-okOEq">'Fall Into Pieces'</a>  were written within several weeks of each other. I had
just moved to Los Angeles, and was trying to reconcile with what I’d left behind
in Canada. Relationships, Loss, Happiness — <br> the songs document an entire mess of
my experiences that all ended up on paper in a short period of time.<br>

I think it’s a mistake to define music before listeners have a chance to hear it.
They’re really just love songs — plain and simple. <br>

05/22/16 put the songs in context for me. <br>
Dates heavily inform the way we
write and consume, so when I realized it was a common thread, it made sense as a title for the project. <br>The date is important to me, and I really believe it will
come across in the music."</br>
